1. Introduction and Release Notes
=================================
iPHP is a module for the popular PHP IRC bot PHP-IRC.  I created this module for use
in php related help channels, this module will allow users to lookup information on php
functions without having to load the php.net website.

=================================
1-a. What's new in 1.0b!
=================================
The largest change in this version is that I have added database support.  You can turn
the database support on or off.  With the addition of the iphp_config.php file you have
the ability to turn database support or caching on or off.

When it comes to caching, the module will store the function information locally so that
it can be used again when the function is called again.  If you are using the database
support, the cached items will be stored until you reset the cache.  However if you are not
using the database support, the cache is reset everytime the bot is shutdown, and when you
reload the modules using the reloadfun command.

I have also added the aiblity to tell someone else the function information.  Sometimes someone
will ask a question and rather than tell them how to use the bot or explain the answer it is
easier to just have the bot tell them the information.  The syntax for this command is

!iphp tell <nickname> about <function>

Here is some example output.

The command
!iphp tell Asylum about strpos

This came to me
[07:59] 	-IdleBot-	[iPHP] - telling Asylum about strpos

This went to Asylum
[07:59] 	-IdleBot-	[iPHP] - Idle0ne wants you to know about strpos
[07:59] 	-IdleBot-	[iPHP] - php.net response for strpos
[07:59] 	-IdleBot-	[iPHP] - strpos -- Find position of first occurrence of a string
[07:59] 	-IdleBot-	[iPHP] - PHP 3, PHP 4, PHP 5
[07:59] 	-IdleBot-	[iPHP] - int strpos ( string haystack, mixed needle [, int offset] )
[07:59] 	-IdleBot-	[iPHP] - http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php

Some statistical information is also stored about each function call, i added a hit counter
however it is not in use yet.
